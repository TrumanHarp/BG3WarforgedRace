# THIS MOD IS NOT FINISHED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
However, it is being actively worked on, and most racial features are working.
## Warforged
Built to fight, Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Warforged can be a steadfast ally or a cold-hearted killing machine.
